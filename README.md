# Stroop Test
========

An implementation of the Stroop Test including difficulty settings.

## General information
From the respective [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect#Stroop_test):
> The Stroop effect has been used to investigate a person's psychological capacities; since its discovery during the twentieth century, it has become a popular neuropsychological test. In psychology, the Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task.
When the name of a color (e.g., "blue", "green", or "red") is printed in a color which is not denoted by the name (i.e., the word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color.
The effect is named after John Ridley Stroop, who first published the effect in English in 1935.
